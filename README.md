<a><strong>Hey all! This repository is aimed at providing the newbies with essential resources to kick start their journey into programming and herein you can find the material organised into a 4-week program.</strong></a>

But trust me, you've got this. Now follow these instructions step by step at your own pace and before you know it, GitHub and coding will become your closest buddies. Well, more like <em><strong>frenemies</em></strong> but that is out of the scope of this discussion :D </p>
